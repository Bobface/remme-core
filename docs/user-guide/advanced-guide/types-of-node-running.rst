Types of node running
=====================

As stated in our guides, during the first run, you need to initialize the genesis block (first block on the blockchain)
with a command ``make run_genesis_bg`` that have run your node in background mode (no output to the terminal window).

There is also a bunch of commands, similar to those you performed with make ``run_genesis_bg``:

1. ``make stop`` to stop the node.
2. ``make run_genesis`` to run a node in genesis mode, not in the background.
3. ``make run`` to start a node if youâ€™re not starting it for the first time; first time start should be a genesis.
4. ``make run_bg`` the same as the command above, but to run the node in background mode.
