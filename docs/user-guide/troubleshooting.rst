Troubleshooting
***************

Troubleshooting is a form of problem solving, often applied to repair failed products or processes on a machine or a system.
Troubleshooting is needed to identify the symptoms. Determining the most likely cause allows to eliminate the potential
causes of a problem.

Command line notation
=====================

Throughout the documentation, we’ll show some commands used in the terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with ``$``.
You don’t need to type in the ``$`` character, it indicates the start of each command. Lines that don’t start with ``$`` typically show
the output of the previous command.

The typical command line interface looks like this. There two separated commands, so you should enter it one by one.

.. code-block:: console

   $ export REMME_CORE_RELEASE=0.7.0-alpha
   $ ./scripts/run.sh -d

Nodes network
=============

As of now, it’ is impossible to connect your own node to the test network. All nodes that you run will work on your own network.

Open terminal
=============

Windows 8
~~~~~~~~~

Swipe up to show the ``Apps screen``. You can accomplish the same thing with a mouse by clicking on the down arrow
icon at the bottom of the screen. Prior to the ``Windows 8.1`` update, the ``Apps screen`` can be accessed from the
``Start screen`` by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, or right-clicking anywhere, and then choosing ``All apps``.

Now that you're on the Apps screen, swipe or scroll to the right and locate the ``Windows System`` section heading.

Under ``Windows System``, tap or click ``Command Prompt``. A new ``Command Prompt`` window will open on the ``Desktop``.

Install Docker
==============

Mac OS
~~~~~~

Visit |page_to_download_docker| to download ``Docker`` from the official website. Downloading requires an account registration.

.. |page_to_download_docker| raw:: html

   <a href="https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac" target="_blank">this page</a>

.. image:: /img/user-guide/troubleshooting/install-docker/mac-os/download-docker.png

You are prompted to authorize ``Docker`` with your system password after you launch it. Privileged access is needed to
install networking components and links to the Docker apps.

The whale in the top status bar indicates that ``Docker`` is running, and accessible from a terminal.

SSH key
=======

``Secure Shell (SSH)`` is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.
Typical applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with ``SSH``.

Visit |what_are_ssh_keys_reference| for more detailed experience with ``SSH``.

.. |what_are_ssh_keys_reference| raw:: html

   <a href="https://jumpcloud.com/blog/what-are-ssh-keys/" target="_blank">this page</a>

Windows
~~~~~~~

You should check for existing SSH keys on your local computer by the ``cd %userprofile%/.ssh`` terminal command.
If you see ``No such file or directory``, then there aren't any existing keys.

If you don't have an existing ``SSH key`` that you wish to use, log in to your local computer as an administrator,
type the terminal command ``ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your-email@example.com``, use your own email here.
Associating the key with your email address helps you to identify the key later on. Just press ``Enter`` to accept the
default location and file name. If the ``.ssh`` directory doesn't exist, the system creates one for you.
Enter, and re-enter, a passphrase when prompted.

The whole interaction will look similar to the picture below.

To get the ``SSH public key`` use the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd %userprofile%/.ssh
   $ clip < id_rsa.pub

The last command will copy it to your buffer, so you can to paste it anywhere.

Ubuntu & Mac OS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should check for existing ``SSH keys`` on your local computer by the ``cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` terminal command.
