A user guide or user's guide, also commonly known as a manual, is a technical communication document intended to give
assistance to people using a particular system.[1] It is usually written by a technical writer, although user guides
are written by programmers, product or project managers, or other technical staff, particularly in smaller companies.

User guides are most commonly associated with electronic goods, computer hardware and software, although they can
be written for any product. Most user guides contain both a written guide and the associated images.
In the case of computer applications, it is usual to include screenshots of the human-machine interface(s), and
hardware manuals often include clear, simplified diagrams. The language used is matched to the intended audience,
with jargon kept to a minimum or explained thoroughly.
